# Receipt Analyzer App
Welcome to Receipt Analyzer App!

Have you ever lost a receipt? All of those paper receipts can become a hassle really quickly. 
I used to take pictures of the receipts but that wasn't great either because there would be no sense of organization among the receipts.

Our app aims to do 2 things:
1. Make your paper receipt electronic by simply taking a photo and storing all of them in a easy to navigate UI 
2. Use image-to-text conversion to make receipts searchable by store name, purchase date, or amount spent
