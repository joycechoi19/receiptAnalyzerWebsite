Welcome to Receipt Analyzer App!

Have you ever lost a receipt? All of those paper receipts can become a hassle really quickly. 
I used to take pictures of the receipts but that wasn't great either because there would be no sense of organization among the receipts.

Our app aims to do 2 things:
1) Make your paper receipt electronic by simply taking a photo and storing all of them in a easy to navigate UI 
2) Use image-to-text conversion to make receipts searchable by store name, purchase date, or amount spent

Work that has been done (Alpha):
Helen:
Josh: integrated API, created "editing screen"
Stephanie:
Joyce: Created user registration, login, and logout using Firebase.

Work that will be done (Beta):
Helen:
Josh: Transfer tapped text on screen to "editing screen", help move tapped text to database
Stephanie:
Joyce: Will help Helen with pulling receipt information from database to display on receipt info page in CardView
